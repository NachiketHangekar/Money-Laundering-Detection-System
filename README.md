# 💸 Money Laundering Detection System

## 📘 Overview
The **Money Laundering Detection System** is a machine learning-based project designed to identify suspicious financial transactions that may indicate potential money laundering activities. The system leverages data-driven techniques to analyze transaction patterns and flag anomalies that deviate from legitimate financial behavior.

This project demonstrates the use of **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, **model training**, and **evaluation** to build a predictive system for fraud detection in the financial domain.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect potentially fraudulent or suspicious transactions using machine learning algorithms.
- Minimize false positives to ensure legitimate transactions are not flagged unnecessarily.
- Provide explainable and interpretable model outputs to support decision-making by financial analysts or compliance teams.
- Demonstrate an end-to-end data science workflow for real-world financial fraud detection problems.

## 🧠 Key Features
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding transaction patterns and distributions.  
- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling.  
- ⚙️ **Machine Learning Models** – Implementation of algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost for classification.  
- 🧾 **Model Evaluation** – Using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.  
- 🧩 **Anomaly Detection** – Identification of outlier transactions based on model predictions.

## 🏗️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection** – Import or generate a dataset simulating real financial transactions.  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Remove inconsistencies, duplicates, and handle missing data.  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Create meaningful variables such as transaction frequency, amount deviation, etc.  
4. **Model Building** – Train supervised learning models for classification.  
5. **Evaluation** – Measure model performance and visualize results using confusion matrices and ROC curves.  
6. **Deployment (Optional)** – Future extension could involve API deployment or real-time prediction using Flask or FastAPI.
